# Dealership-Locator
Find your local GM Dealerships
## Synopsis

Dealership Locator helps the Account Advocate organize dealerships by what their inventory carries by displaying them on a map as well as list form.

## Motivation

It occured to me one day how annoying it is filtering through multiple Excel sheets or forgetting which one of my dealers were with a given OEM. Why not create a web app that organizes it all for you? 

## Installation

To access the source files, you can clone the repo. 

## Contributors

So far just me, Noah.
